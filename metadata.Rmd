# Site

The weather station is located at the Viikki campus of the University of Helsinki, in the experimental field. Nearest buildings are far, but some trees are growing at xxx m to the North-North-East of the tower. Coordinates: 25.01673 E, 60.2253 N.

# The logger

A Campbell CR6 datalogger, with 24-bit resolution ADC was used, reading all sensors once every 5 s and computing different summaries at 1 min, 1 h, and 1 d intervals. Each of these sets of summaries are in different tables in the logger and in separate text files in the data downloaded from the logger. The logger was initially powered only through a battery charged by a solar panel. This arrangement did not suffice to power the logger over the winter and an a power supply (Mean-Well,  ) connected to mains power was added on xxxxx. The power source feeds into the battery controller in parallel with the solar panel. Sensors have been added from time to time, the original BF5 sensor malfunctioned and needed replacement. The signal from some sensors is measured as an analogue voltage while others through a serial interface, in which case digital data is received by the logger. The table below gives the list of sensors and the dates when they were added.

Radiation sensors are at x meters above the ground surface, on a tower arm on the South of the tower. The WXT520 sensor was on the same arm but on the North side of the tower, at a distance of x.x m from the tower, until 2019-0X-XX when it was moved to a separate arm on the E side of the tower at 2.xx m height at a distance of x.x m from the tower. The hemispherical photograph below was taken from sensors' position and elevation, North at top.

# Import and preprocessing of the data

```{r}
data_folders <- c("data-2016-2", "data-2019-march", "data-2019-april-02", "data-2019-september-18")
object_names <- gsub("-", "_", data_folders) %>% gsub("data", "day", .) %>% paste(. , "tb", sep = ".")
file_paths <- paste(data_folders, "CR6Series_TableDay.dat", sep = "/")
index <- 4L
```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(photobiology)
library(photobiologyInOut)
library(ggspectra)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
```

We store the coordinates of the station. (I need to replace these values with the exact ones as these are off by about 200 m.)

```{r}
viikki_bio3.geo <- data.frame(lon = 25.01673, lat = 60.2253, address = "BIO3, Viikki")
locale_FI <- locale(tz = "Europe/Helsinki")
```

We read the minute interval data for the whole summer. However, there is a rather long gap in the time series in July.

```{r}
day.tb <- read_csi_dat(file = file_paths[index], locale = locale_FI)
nrow(day.tb)
ncol(day.tb)
```

```{r}
colnames(day.tb)
```

```{r}
cat(comment(day.tb))
```

This should have worked with the code above, but did not!!

```{r}
day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1]
tz(day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1])
day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]] <- force_tz(day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]], tzone = "Europe/Helsinki")
day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1]
tz(day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1])
```

```{r}
colnames(day.tb)
```

```{r}
ggplot(day.tb, aes(TIMESTAMP, BattV_Min)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
assign(object_names[index], day.tb)
```


```{r}
save(list = object_names[index], file = paste(object_names[index], "rda", sep = "."))
```

```{r}
day.tb %>%
  tail() %>%
write.csv(file = "day_tb.csv")
```
