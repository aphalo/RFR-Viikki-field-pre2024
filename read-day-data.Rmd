# The data

A Campbell CR6 datalogger was used, reading all sensors once every 5 s and computing different summaries at 1 min, 1 h, and 1 d intervals. Each of these sets of summaries are in different tables in the logger and different text files in the data read in. In the hourly data in addition to means, standard errors, maxima and minima as in minute-interval data, histograms for radiation data, computed in the logger, are also available. In hourly and daily data, times for maxima and minima have also been recorded. The table below gives the list of sensors. There is a gap in the data during July.

Sensor type       | make       | variable           | s.n.           | calibration date
:---------------- |:---------- |:------------------ |:-------------- |:----------------
LI-190 quantum    | LI-COR     | PAR (total PPFD)   |                |
SMP3 pyramometer  | Kipp       | global radiation   |                |
BF5               | Delta-T    | PAR (total PPFD)   |                |

Sensors are at x meters above the ground surface, on a tower arm on the South of the tower. The hemispherical photograph below was taken from sensors' position and elevation, North at top.

# Import and preprocessing of the data

```{r}
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(photobiology)
library(photobiologyInOut)
library(ggspectra)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
```

We store the coordinates of the station. (I need to replace these values with the exact ones as these are off by about 200 m.)

```{r}
viikki_bio3.geo <- data.frame(lon = 25.019212, lat = 60.226805, address = "BIO3, Viikki")
locale_UTC <- locale(tz = "UTC")
# locale_FI <- locale(tz = "Europe/Helsinki")
```

```{r}
data_folders <- c("data-2016-2", "data-2019-march", "data-2019-april-02", "data-2020-01-14", "data-latest")
object_names <- gsub("-", "_", data_folders) %>% gsub("data", "day", .) %>% paste(. , "tb", sep = ".")
#file_paths <- paste(data_folders, "CR6Series_TableDay.dat", sep = "/")
file_paths <- paste(data_folders, "Viikki Tower_TableDay.dat", sep = "/")
index <- 5L
```

We read the minute interval data for the whole summer. However, there is a rather long gap in the time series in July.

```{r}
day.tb <- read_csi_dat(file = file_paths[index], locale = locale_FI)
nrow(day.tb)
ncol(day.tb)
```

```{r}
colnames(day.tb)
```

```{r}
cat(comment(day.tb))
```

This should have worked with the code above, but did not!!

```{r}
day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1]
tz(day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1])
day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]] <- force_tz(day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]], tzone = "Europe/Helsinki")
day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1]
tz(day.tb[["TIMESTAMP"]][1])
```

```{r}
colnames(day.tb)
```

```{r}
ggplot(day.tb, aes(TIMESTAMP, BattV_Min)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
assign(object_names[index], day.tb)
```


```{r}
save(list = object_names[index], file = paste(object_names[index], "rda", sep = "."))
```

```{r}
day.tb %>%
  tail() %>%
write.csv(file = "day_tb5.csv")
```
